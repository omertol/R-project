# SISE2601 Project data description
================
**Group P**

*The data:* 
Spike list/Potential action - records of transfer electronic signals between neurons.
The data contains six Excel files, each of them have 5 columns and more than 400,000 rows.
Explanation to every column:
1. "Investigator" and cloumn no.2 (missing name) - General information about the reserch like: "Experiment Start Time" (date) and "Temperature" .
  "Investigator" - The title
2. cloumn no.2 - The information
3. "Time (s)" - Time record of transfer electronic signals by specific neuron, counted in seconds.
4. "Electrode" - ID number of neuron who transfer electronic signals at the specific time. 
    Details :
    ID number has 2 parts (separated by a lower dash): 
    part no.1 - Petri dish number 
    part no.2 - Electrode number
5. "Amplitude (mV)" - Measurement of the voltage of electronic signals who created by neuron, measured in millivolt.

At the end of the Excel file there is information about each Petri dish, such as: the type of treatment he received, activity, etc.
