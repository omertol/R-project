# SISE2601 Project data description
================
**Group P**

*The data:* 
Spike list/Potential action - records of transfer electronic signals between neurons.
The data contains six Excel files, each of them have 5 columns and more than 400,000 rows, 
Every Excel files describes different time periods on the research:
1. Before treatment.
2. Right after treatment.
3. 4 hours after treatment.
4. 5 hours from the moment the night started.
5. 11 hours from the moment the night started.
6. 18 hours from the moment the night started.
The records contains the time and the Petri dish number_Electrode number who transfering electronic signals, also called "potential action".

Explanation to every column:
1. "Investigator" and cloumn no.2 (missing name) - General information about the reserch like: "Experiment Start Time" (date) and "Temperature" .
  "Investigator" - The title
2. cloumn no.2 - The information
3. "Time (s)" - Time record of transfer electronic signals by specific neuron, counted in seconds.
4. "Electrode" - ID number of neuron who transfer electronic signals at the specific time. 
    Details :
    ID number has 2 parts (separated by a lower dash): 
    part no.1 - Petri dish number 
    part no.2 - Electrode number
5. "Amplitude (mV)" - Measurement of the voltage of electronic signals who created by neuron, measured in millivolt.

At the end of the Excel file there is information about each Petri dish, such as: the type of treatment he received, activity, etc.
