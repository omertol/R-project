# The Differences Between Various Memory-Improvement Treatments on Neurons using Multielectrode Array
### Advanced Data Analysis in R

This is a R-language project which was created as part of "Advanced Data Analysis in R" course in Ben Gurion University, Israel. 

To replicate our analysis, please follow the next steps: 
* Place the data in the `/data/spike data` folder of this repository 
* Change the `bl div16(000)_spike_list.csv` file name to `a bl div16(000)_spike_list` so it will appear first in the folder
* Run the `analysis.Rmd` file

The KNN model is not part of the final results due to accuracy issues. If you would like to test its results, the same steps should be applied, just run the `KNN.Rmd` instead!
The output of this file is identical to the results we presented in the report submitted.
