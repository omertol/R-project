# Final project

This is a R-language project which was created as part of "Advanced Data Analysis in R" course in Ben Gurion University, Israel. 

To replicate our analysis, please follow the next steps: 
* Place the data in the `/data/spike data` folder of this repository 
* Change the `bl div16(000)_spike_list.csv` file name to `a bl div16(000)_spike_list` so it will appear first in the folder
* Run the `analysis.rmd` file
